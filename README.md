===============================

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.json/json.svg)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json)


# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

This project is intended for learning and improving org.json library's functions. Based on the original org.json package, this version includes more useful functions like reading and replacing a child json object quickly, dealing with json objects in concurrent style and so on. 


# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Intellij IDEA.
 
**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
````
javac org/json/*.java
````

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
````
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
````

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
````
javac -cp .;json-java.jar Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:json-java.jar Test.java (Unix Systems)
````

*Test file contents*

````
import org.json.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo.toString());
    }
}
````

*Execute the Test file*
```` 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
````

*Expected output*

````
{"abc":"def"}
````

 
**Tools to build the package and execute the unit tests**

Execute the test suite with Maven:
```
mvn clean test
```

Execute the test suite with Gradlew:

```
gradlew clean build test
```
